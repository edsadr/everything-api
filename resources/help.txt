[35m[4m[1m# The Everything API[22m[24m[39m

[0mThis is an API that is able to return almost any GET REST endpoint you want. Just provide the URL and the API will return the AI generated JSON for you inferring the content from the URL, it uses OpenAI completion API with GPT-3.5-Turbo by default to generate the JSON so it requires an OpenAI API key.[0m

[0mOnce an endpoint is consumed, the data is stored in a cache that does not expire. This way, the API can return the same data without having to generate the original endpoint again.[0m
